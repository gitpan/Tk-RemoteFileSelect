NAME
      RemoteFileSelect.pm--Browse directories with FTP.

SYNOPSIS
      use Tk::RemoteFileSelect;
      use Tk::LoginDialog;

      my $dialog;  # Reference to RemoteFileSelect widget.
      my $file;    # File selected in the widget.

      $dialog = $mw -> RemoteFileSelect( -directory => '.' );
      $file = $dialog -> Show;

DESCRIPTION
    A RemoteFileSelect dialog contains two Listboxes that display
    subdirectories and files, a directory Entry and a file name Entry, and
    buttons for each operation that are labeled with Alt-key accelerators.

    When you select a file in the Listbox, RemoteFileSelect returns that
    file's name when you click on the "Accept" button. RemoteFileSelect also
    returns a file name if you press Enter after typing a name in the file
    Entry, or double click on a selection in the file Listbox.

    Before returning the filename, RemoteFileSelect verifies whether the
    file exists.

    If Net::FTP, part of libnet, is installed, RemoteFileSelect activates an
    additional "Host" button. Clicking "Host" prompts you for the name of a
    remote system, and your user name and password. After logging in with
    FTP, you can browse and select files on the remote system.

    If a file name is selected on the local system, then RemoteFileSelect
    returns the path to the file, the same as a standard FileSelect widget.

    If a file is selected on a remote host, then RemoteFileSelect returns
    the name in the form:

      host:/full-pathname-of-file

    If RemoteFileSelect cannot find and load Net::FTP, the dialog box
    behaves like a standard FileSelect widget, and the "Host" button is
    grayed out.

    RemoteFileSelect.pm was developed with the Net::FTP module distributed
    with libnet-1.12, from http://www.cpan.org/.

    All other operations perform as in a Tk::FileSelect widget. Please refer
    to the Tk::FileSelect man page.
