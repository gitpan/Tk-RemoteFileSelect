NAME
      RemoteFileSelect.pm--Browse directories with FTP.

SYNOPSIS
      require Tk::RemoteFileSelect;

      my $file = $mw -> Tk::RemoteFileSelect( -directory => '.' );

DESCRIPTION
      A RemoteFileSelect contains two listboxes that display
      subdirectories and files, a directory entry and a file name
      entry, and buttons for each operation, which are labeled
      with Alt-key accelerators.

      When entering a file name, the RemoteFileSelect verifies 
      whether the file already exists.  If a file is selected
      in the listbox, the RemoteFileSelect returns that file's
      name when the user clicks the 'Accept' button, presses
      Enter after typing a name in the file entry, or double
      clicking on a selection in the file list box.

      Additionally, if the Net::FTP module is installed, RemoteFileSelect
      will activate an additional "Host" button on the FileSelect widget,
      where you can enter the host name, and your user id and password,
      and select files on the remote host.

      If a file name is selected on the local host, then 
      the RemoteFileSelect widget returns the path to the 
      file name, the same as a standard FileSelect widget.

      If a file is selected on a remote host, then the 
      RemoteFileSelect widget returns the name in the form:

      host:/full-pathname-of-file

      RemoteFileSelect requires the Net::FTP module to be 
      installed.  If it cannot find and load Net::FTP, the
      RemoteFileSelect widget behaves like a standard
      FileSelect widget, and the "Host" button is grayed out.

      RemoteFileSelect.pm was developed with the Net::FTP
      module distributed with libnet-1.0703, from
      http://www.cpan.org/.

      All other operations function as in a FileSelect widget.
      Please refer to the FileSelect.pm POD documentation.
