NAME
      RemoteFileSelect.pm--Browse directories with FTP.

SYNOPSIS
      use Tk::RemoteFileSelect;
      use Tk::LoginDialog;

      my $dialog;  # Reference to RemoteFileSelect widget.
      my $file;    # File selected in the widget.

      $dialog = $mw -> RemoteFileSelect( -directory => '.' );
      $file = $dialog -> Show;

DESCRIPTION
    A RemoteFileSelect dialog contains two listboxes that display
    subdirectories and files, a directory entry and a file name entry, and
    buttons for each operation, which are labeled with Alt-key accelerators.

    When entering a file name, RemoteFileSelect verifies whether the file
    already exists. If a file is selected in the listbox, RemoteFileSelect
    returns that file's name when the user clicks the 'Accept' button,
    presses Enter after typing a name in the file entry, or double clicks on
    a selection in the file list box.

    Additionally, if the Net::FTP module is installed, RemoteFileSelect
    activates an additional "Host" button. Clicking "Host" prompts for the
    name of a remote system, and your user name and password. After logging
    in with FTP, you can browse and select files on the remote system.

    If a file name is selected on the local system, then RemoteFileSelect
    returns the path to the file, the same as a standard FileSelect widget.

    If a file is selected on a remote host, then RemoteFileSelect returns
    the name in the form:

      host:/full-pathname-of-file

    RemoteFileSelect requires Net::FTP, part of libnet, to be installed. If
    it cannot find and load Net::FTP, RemoteFileSelect behaves like a
    standard FileSelect widget, and the "Host" button is grayed out.

    RemoteFileSelect.pm was developed with the Net::FTP module distributed
    with libnet-1.12, from http://www.cpan.org/.

    All other operations function as in a FileSelect widget. Please refer to
    the FileSelect.pm POD documentation.
