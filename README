Refer all questions and problem reports to the author,
rkiesling@earthlink.net.


System requirements:

1.  A Unix or derivative operating system.
2.  Perl version 5.005 or greater.
3.  Perl/Tk, version 800.x.
4.  The Net::FTP.pm module, distributed in libnet from CPAN.
5.  GNU make.


Installation:

1.  Unpack the RemoteFileSelect archive.

  tar zxvf RemoteFileSelect-0.59.tar.gz

2.  Change to the top-level subdirectory:

  $ cd Tk-RemoteFileSelect-0.59

3.  The top-level Makefile should work on any Unix or derivative
    system.  It uses the host system's Perl installation to 
    build the package Makefiles.  At the prompt, type:

  $ perl Makefile.PL

4.  Build the program modules and documentation.  Type:

  $ make

5.  If necessary, become root (via "su", for example), and 
    install the source files and documentation in the system's 
    site_perl library, and the "browser" script in 
    /usr/local/bin, using the "make install" command:

  $ su
  Enter Password:
  # make install
