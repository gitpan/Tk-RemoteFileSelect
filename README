Tk::RemoteFileSelect.pm, version 0.60, installation.

System requirements:

1.  Perl, version 5.005 or greater.
2.  Perl/Tk, version 800.x.
3.  The Net::FTP.pm module, distributed with libnet, from CPAN.
4.  GNU make.


Installation:

1.  Unpack the RemoteFileSelect archive.

  $ tar zxvf RemoteFileSelect-0.60.tar.gz

2.  Change to the top-level subdirectory:

  $ cd Tk-RemoteFileSelect-0.60

3.  The top-level Makefile should work on any Unix or derivative
    system.  It uses the host system's Perl installation to 
    build the package Makefiles.  At the prompt, type:

  $ perl Makefile.PL

4.  Build the program modules and documentation.  Type:

  $ make

5.  If necessary, become root (via, "su," for example), and 
    install the source files and documentation in the system's 
    site_perl library.

  $ su
  Enter Password:
  # make install
